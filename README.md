# snedit-portable
A "desktop" client for SNEdit.

## Why not call it SNEdit Desktop?
It's not a native desktop client. It's just the website running in an Electron window.

I don't want to name it as if it was native (as if you can run it offline), because it isn't, and I would be lying.

However, until a solution from Cube Enix releases, this is a legit way to run
SNEdit that isn't in your browser.

## Y no app icon on macOS?

I got lazy.
